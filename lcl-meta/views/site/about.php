        <big><big>Significant gains could be made if relevant evidence was used to inform decisions<br>
                on how to best shape built environment around us. <br>
                But this is not easy.</big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">major obstacles</span> are:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                the sheer volume of this evidence, <br>
                its obscurity and accessibility, <br>
                variation of the quality of the evidence.</big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big>Sometimes we do not need to reinvent the wheel<br>
                &nbsp;&#8211; when good and unbiased reviews of evidence or summaries of the topic already exist,<br>
                Why not use them?</big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big>By collecting and assessing best existing evidence and topic reviews,<br>
                we aim to make them more <span style="font-weight: bold;">discoverable</span>, <br>
                helping sharing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">knowledge and good practice.</span></big></big><br>

    <big><big>There are many types of evidence,<br>
            but not all are equally reliable.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Systematic reviews and meta-analyses* </span><br>
            are considered to be the least biased forms of evidence synthesis.<br>
            <br>
            This is true, if they follow a systematic review process &#8211; <br>
            procedures designed to reduce risk of bias* and increase transparency*.<br>
            <br>
            To reduce risk of bias in our database we followed the systematic review process. &nbsp;<br>
            We are also transparent about what we did &#8211; <br>
